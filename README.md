# Huddle Landing Page With Alternating Blocks
### Completion of the Huddle Challange From [FrontendMentor] (https://www.frontendmentor.io)

**To Who It May Concearn**
1. Approach of making
2. Resources Used
3. Bugs

#### Approach Of Making

I used the mobile approach first reason because I find this way more convinient as it's not much work to scale the design 
up to a bigger screen than doing it the other way round.
However I did make use of Media Queries [min-width: 1200px], meaning if screen => than 1200px display this specific styles
you can view the main.css file. 

Also i made use of offline fonts meaning i downloaded my fonts and imported them using the @font-face
CSS property. I also used icons from FontAwesome [Offline Use].


#### Resources Used

In the course of building here are some few resources i made use of.

Fonts >>>>> {Poppins & OpenSans} Downloaded from https://fontsquirrel.com

Icons >>>>> {Facebook ~ Twitter ~ Instagram} FontAwesome ~ https://fontawesome.com

Design Images >>>>> {Mobile & Desktop Design} Provided by FrontendMentor check in [ ./design]

Images >>>>> Provided by FrontendMentor check in [ ./images]

White-Footer Logo >>>>> Logo originally black was converted to a white color using the color fill ~ https://vectorpaint.yaks.co.nz

Also FrontendMentor did provide a style.md {Style Patterns} & Readme.md file. The guide helped in the buiding of the projects.


#### Bugs
They are some few minor bugs which has to do with scaling on a bigger screen.

Even though i made use of Media Queries i still was not able to fully accomplish the desktop view.
Some Issues Are

** First Note That The Bugs Are Only Visibe On A Desktop/Laptop Screen => 1200px **

1. Footer: ON screen =>At 1200px or above the footer still looks same as a mobile site.

2. The Hero Section not realy scaled well according to design but still looks good so no worries :)

3. Also the main section the 'rounded box like stuff' appears to be big and text are not in the right place, but i did try my best to
fit in the images well.

All other bugs not mentioned here are not known by me, do tell me if it scaled badly on your mobile, if possibe i would love to 
know 
1. Name of Phone Viewd On
2. Browser Currently Using
3. Screenshot if possible
